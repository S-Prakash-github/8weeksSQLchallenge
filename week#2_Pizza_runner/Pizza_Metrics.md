FROM 
    customer_orders;

##### OUTPUT 
| unique_order|
|-------------|
|    10       |


##### EXPLANATION
- SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS unique_order: This part of the query calculates the count of distinct order_id values from the customer_orders table and aliases the result as unique_order.

- FROM customer_orders: This specifies the source table, indicating that the count is to be calculated from the customer_orders table.
